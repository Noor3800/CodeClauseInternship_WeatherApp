# 🌦️ Weather Web App(Internship Project)

Hey this is a simple and responsive weather application that I made during my **CodeClause Internship** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, just vibes 💫. It fetches real-time weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city.

💡 Type a city name and boom — you'll get the current weather, temp, humidity, and wind speed — all fetched live from the OpenWeatherMap API!
